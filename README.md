## aka _Yet Another VM Exploration_
This little project is an exploration in to making VM's using a very basic instruction set (sort of based on the Human Resource Machine in game assembly language.) It's mainly to try out different ideas to see what fun little projects I can implement using the VM as a little 8 bit style CPU.
